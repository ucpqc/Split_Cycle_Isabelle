  An electoral result is the principal result type of the composable modules
  voting framework, as it is a generalization of the set of winning
  alternatives from social choice functions. Electoral results are selections
  of the received (possibly empty) set of alternatives into the three disjoint
  groups of elected, rejected and deferred alternatives.
  Any of those sets, e.g., the set of winning (elected) alternatives, may also
  be left empty, as long as they collectively still hold all the received
  alternatives.

  A result contains three sets of alternatives:
  elected, rejected, and deferred alternatives.

  A partition of a set A are pairwise disjoint sets that "set equals
  partition" A. For this specific predicate, we have three disjoint sets
  in a three-tuple.
