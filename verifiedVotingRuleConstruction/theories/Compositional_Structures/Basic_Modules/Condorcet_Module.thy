  This is the Condorcet module used by the Condorcet (voting) rule. The
  Condorcet rule is a voting rule that implements the Condorcet criterion,
  i.e., it elects the Condorcet winner if it exists, otherwise a tie remains
  between all alternatives. The module implemented herein only rejects the
  alternatives not elected by the voting rule, and defers the alternatives that
  would be elected by the full voting rule.
