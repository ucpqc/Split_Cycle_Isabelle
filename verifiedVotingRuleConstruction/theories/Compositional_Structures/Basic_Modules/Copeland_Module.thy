  This is the Copeland module used by the Copeland voting rule. The Copeland
  rule elects the alternatives with the highest difference between the amount
  of simple-majority wins and the amount of simple-majority losses. The module
  implemented herein only rejects the alternatives not elected by the voting
  rule, and defers the alternatives that would be elected by the full voting
  rule.
