  This is the Minimax module used by the Minimax voting rule. The Minimax rule
  elects the alternatives with the highest Minimax score. The module implemented
  herein only rejects the alternatives not elected by the voting rule, and defers
  the alternatives that would be elected by the full voting rule.
