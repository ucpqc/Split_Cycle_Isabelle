  The elect composition sequences an electoral module and the elect
  module. It finalizes the module's decision as it simply elects all their
  non-rejected alternatives. Thereby, any such elect-composed module induces
  a proper voting rule in the social choice sense, as all alternatives are
  either rejected or elected.
